Welcome to gobash
=================

gobash is a set of bash functions that improve programming experience
in bash (by providing collections, languages features, APIs, testing
package, command line flag parsing, etc.) without modifying the shell
interpreter(s). It works with any bash version (on Linux and
Mac). Parts of the API are matching those in Go.

gobash is publicly available on `GitHub
<https://github.com/EngineeringSoftware/gobash>`_ under the `BSD 3
license
<https://github.com/EngineeringSoftware/gobash/blob/main/LICENSE>`_.
