Design
======

Key design goal: Implement everything using functions and files (i.e.,
there is no need to change existing shells or existing user code).

As the result, a user can adopt gobash as needed without being forced
to rewrite any of their code, but can benefit by using some/all of
gobash features, which can be introduced gradually.  Additionally,
gobash should work with any `bash` version and OS that runs `bash`.
